# Sorting and Searching Algorithms

This project contains implementations of various sorting and searching algorithms in the programming language Java. It includes both classic sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, quick sort, merge sort) and search methods (linear and binary).

## Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Selection Sort**: An algorithm that selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
3. **Quick Sort**: An efficient algorithm that uses the method of partitioning and conquering. It selects a pivot element, moves all smaller elements to the left of it, and larger elements to the right.
4. **Merge Sort**: An algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges them together.

## Searching Algorithms

1. **Linear Search**: A simple algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the list or array until the desired element is found or all elements have been traversed.
2. **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list. It reduces the search area by half at each step by comparing the target element with the middle element of the list.

## Usage

You can use these algorithms in your projects by importing the corresponding modules and calling the respective functions with your data.
